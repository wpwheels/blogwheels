/// Primary theme stylesheet, which is used for both the front end and the
/// editor. Note that it is named `screen` instead of `style` because
/// `wp-scripts` renames that file to `style-index`. But, it's also an
/// easy way to differentiate it from `print`, which I'll totally add one
/// day. I promise.
